<h1>Get Involved</h1>

<largeitalicp>T</largeitalicp><italicp>here are a lot of ways you can be involved in helping us help the people of Haiti.</italicp>

<h2>Vision Trips</h2>

<p>We know that one of the best ways we can connect people with Haiti and with what we do at Clean Water for Haiti is to have them visit us. While many organizations set up work style trips where a lot of projects are done during the stay we focus on providing our guests with an immersion experience.
Through our annual Vision Trips our guests have the opportunity to see our filter program in full swing. You will learn what goes into producing a filter and see the installation process in Haitian homes when you join our staff on a delivery day. We also believe it's important to share our lives with you and to share what others are doing. Through off site trips you'll be able to see more of the area we live in, a bit of Haitian culture, and will visit other organizations that are doing some great things in Haiti.
By keeping groups limited to 6 people we are able to really spend time getting to know our visitors and share about daily life in Haiti. Because Haiti tends to have unexpected issues arise we don't host visitors under the age of 18.</p>

<h2>Volunteer</h2>
<p>At Clean Water for Haiti we are reliant on our in-country staff of local Haitians to do most of the day to day work of the mission. As we plan for the future we look at what our volunteer needs are and seek people that are able to commit to those needs.
Currently we are not in need of short term volunteers, but rather people that can commit to working with us for a year or more. Because the work we do is technical there is time needed to learning the whole process in order to be most effective, as well as learning Creole and how to work within the culture. Also, as we look at expanding the mission and our reach with Biosand filters we know that one of the greatest areas of need that we have is for volunteers that can come long term and work in positions of leadership.</p>

<p>We are reliant on the donations of individuals and organizations such as foundations, churches, schools, and service clubs to do what we do in Haiti. If you would like to help us fundraise and do promotion in order to spread the word about what we do please contact Leslie Rolling at info@cleanwaterforhaiti.org . We will do what we can to provide you with promotional materials for your event and help you to spread the word.</p>
