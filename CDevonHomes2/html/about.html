<div id="aboutContent">
	<p> Devon has lived in the greater Boston metro-area for 15 years, spending over 10 years in downtown Boston renting everywhere from the South End to North End, finally buying in the Back Bay, and most recently has lived in the out-skirt suburbs of Boston. She brings this unique perspective and Boston-knowledge to her work because she knows AND appreciates both the city and the suburb lifestyle, plus she has the personal experience of making and understanding the big change of living as a city-family, and then relocating to the suburbs. As a result of her own life experiences, she enjoys helping families who need to buy or sell property, ranging anywhere from a modest home or condominium to a residence fit for a large or extended family. </p>

	<p>Her clients and colleagues alike value her talent of listening to what they want, understanding their needs, and delivering in the end. Devon has an energetic and friendly demeanor, yet approaches each job in a diligent, strategic and creative way in order to successfully find each client exactly what they want in a home. Devon's versatility is also an asset. As a mother who's gone from city to suburb, she's also personally experienced living in spaces that vary in size from a loft to a one and two bedroom apartment, and even a two-story multi-family. She remembers and embrasses the challenges each size brings and has conquered the ability to work with a smaller space to make sure to accommodate all the client's needs. </p>

	<p>Additionally, Devon understands what a seller and what a buyer wants and her resources are strong on both sides, not to mention, she has gone through both herself. For the seller, she knows and can spot the minor changes that could lead to a greater sales price; and for the buyer, she knows how to make the space work for their needs. Understanding the needs of the buyer is very important because typically, the real estate person will try to sell the most expensive space on the market and they aren't always listening to the needs of the buyer, who may not be able to stretch to that price point. Devon understands and respects that, and really cares about where her clients live. </p>
